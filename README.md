  2.Collaborative Filter

In Content based we use content to recommed things
for eg. if we take about amazon, in here if a person search about phone or electronic gadgets then possible he/she will be recommended more on the same type of things like laptop , mouse ,pendrives etc.                                                                                                               
                                         
But in collaborative filter we try to find collaboration between different coustomer with same like and dislike for product                                                   
For example if two different people from different parts of the world search same type of product then according to the algorithm they both are same and try to recommand more on what the other person see i.e if the first person see wooden furniture then alogrithm also recommend that product to the second person
